/*
Delete non-ASCII characters from a file
We need to remove the non-ASCII bytes from files.

Write a C program, leave_only_ascii.c, which takes one argument, a filename.

leave_only_ascii.c should remove all non-ASCII bytes from the file.

After it is run the file should contain only a ASCII bytes.

It should print nothing on stdout. It should only change the file.

Assume a byte is non-ASCII if it contains a value between 128..255 inclusive.
